= ChangeLog

== 2010-04-07 Support for Bootstrap Actions

* Added support for bootstrap actions including a new command line parameter
  --bootstrap-action

* Added some extra command line options such as --plain-output, --ssh, 
  and --scp. The --ssh command now waits for the jobflow to be running
  before contacting unless the --no-wait flag is passed.

== 2010-05-27 Support for Hadoop 0.20 and Hive 0.5

* Added support for specifying Hadoop version using --hadoop-version option.  
  Hadoop 0.20 supports Hive 0.5 and Hadoop 0.18 supports Hive 0.4. The default
  Hadoop version is 0.20. 

* Added support for installing Hive using hive-script instead of directly 
  installing a particular version of Hive.
  
* Added support for streaming arguments of Hadoop 0.20 (-files, -archives, -D).

== 2010-09-16 Support for fetching files from EMR

* Added --get option to scp from files EMR. Added symmetric --put option that 
  behaves exactly like --scp.

* Added new arguments for resizing running job flows --add-instance-group, 
  --modify-instance-group, and --unarrest-instance-group.
